# Support For Localized Layouts

The [Zolinga Intl](:Zolinga Intl) module provides support for localized HTML layouts through the extension of the `WebComponent` class.

If you want to load localized HTML layouts when using `/dist/system/js/web-component.js` [Web Component](:Zolinga Core:Web Components:WebComponent Class)'s `loadContent()` methods in you JS files, you can use the `/dist/zolinga-intl/js/web-component-intl.js` module instead. It extends the `WebComponent` class with the ability to load localized HTML files automatically.
